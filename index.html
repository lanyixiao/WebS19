layout: page
permalink: /

p.s., i was checking on these items, most of them were: 

<li> scss file </li>
i created .scss along with .css, i just don't know how to watch it. 
but since i attached the .css in _layouts, so the changes in .css are made to changed simultaneously in all pages. 

<li> Data </li> 
(which can be found in data/navigation.yaml)

<li> A loop that iterates over the data </li>
 (the loop statement ' {% for item in site.data.navigation %}  ' can be found in _includes/navigation.html)

<li>1 layout </li>
(the layout can be found in _layouts/page.html.)
(i adjusted the css file and added a javascript file)

<li>1 partial </li>
no idea what it is...
